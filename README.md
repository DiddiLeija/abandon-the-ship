# Diddi Finds the Strongman

My GameOff 2022 submission.

## Storyline

> The tribal knowledge says **the strongman is always the hero**.
> Ok, it's not a tribal knowledge, it's actually an old _clichÃ©_.
>
> Anyway, **Diddi**, our hero, has visited a strange, little planet named **Shorty**,
> which's filled up with little people. Diddi's come to save that planet
> from destruction... because a great disaster will come soon.
>
> The Shorty's leader, the Short King, says the only thing will save them is...
> **the Strongman**, the only big guy in the planet. Diddi offers his own 
> help, but the leader refuses the help, since Diddi... let's just say
> he is not as athletic as the Shorty's people would like on an allay.
> He's brilliant, but not a strongman. And only strongmen can be real heroes.
>
> Diddi, out of options, will have to find that "strongman" to save planet Shorty.

You will have to help Diddi find that mysterious individual on planet Shorty.
