>
> [Diddi](https://diddileija.github.io/wiki/Diddi), our space tech hero,

> If Diddi wants to appear on further games and stories, he should "abandon the ship"
> as soon as possible!

You'll have to help Diddi abandon the Confidence before it collapses. Avoid dangerous
zones, and reach out the escape pods to survive!
