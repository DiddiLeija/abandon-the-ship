# Abandon the ship!

My GameOff 2022 submission.

## Storyline

> Saying "Abandon the ship!" is a quite frequent phrase,
> actually it's considered an old _clichÃ©_...
>
> ...
>
> [Diddi](https://diddileija.github.io/wiki/Diddi), our space tech hero,
> is stuck on a damaged space cruiser, the **Confidence**. Everybody left. The ship was
> attacked a few moments ago, and now it's doomed to destruction.
>
> If Diddi wants to appear on further games and stories, he should "abandon the ship"
> as soon as possible!

You'll have to help Diddi abandon the Confidence before it collapses. Avoid dangerous
zones, and reach out the escape pods to survive!
