Script to generate the Windows-only executable
(packaged as "windows.zip"). It uses cx_Freeze,
and generates everything by running the command
"setup.py build".
The reference for cx_Freeze can be found at
<https://github.com/marcelotduarte/cx_Freeze>.
After generating everything, get sure to add the
"resource.pyxres" at the "build/exe.{whatever that goes here}"
directory!
