Are you stuck? Don't know where to start? Don't worry,
this guide has come to save you!

Reach out the escape pod (see below) to safely exit the
_Confidence_ ship before it crashes!

## Main keys

Press `Q` whenever you want to exit the game.

### Menu

- **P**: Start the game.
- **G**: A quick guide of using the keys during the game.
- **C**: A small sequence, that suggests visiting [this credits file](THANKS.md).

### Game

- **WASD keys - Arrow keys**: Horizontal movement.
- **Space**: Jump.

## How to win

- **Avoid the fire!** If you touch it, you'll loose the game.
- **Never fall into a pit.** Burning is not the only way to die in this game. Jump to avoid fatal falls.

### NOTE: Restarting the game

Due to some issues, you cannot restart the game without closing it and trying again [^1]. If you're using the in-browser version, you can just refresh the page. If not, you'll have to close the app/file and run it again.
